# The Little Prover

This repository contains "J-Bob", the proof assistant from "The Little Prover"
by Daniel P. Friedman and Carl Eastlund, published by MIT Press in 2015.  We
include the necessary code to run J-Bob in ACL2 and Scheme, as well as a
transcript of the proofs in the book.  J-Bob is also included in the Dracula
package for Racket.
